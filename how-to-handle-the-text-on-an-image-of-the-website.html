            <img class="main-image" src="images/group.png" alt="Image having text on it.">
            <p>While designing a website, one of the most common and frustrating thing we come across is placing a text at some random position on an image. It looks awesome if have the sufficient contrast between the image and the text, but it feels like a nightmare if we don't. At the time when I first noticed this problem, I used to edit the image itself to make the text look good on it. :(</p>
            <p>One of the use-case is having a slider on the landing page of a website. A slider on a website is a changing content area with different "slides" of visual or information. The slides may include a large image and they may also include text and button overlaid on top.</p>
            <p>Over the years of designing and developing websites, I came to know about 2 methods to overcome this problem which we be discussing below.</p>
            <h2>Background overlay</h2>
            <p>Background overlay is a feature available as a property in Wordpress development. But in CSS it's not available as a property, but by using a code similar to below on a image, we can achieve a similar effect.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>
                    .image {<br>
                        background: linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(39, 151, 216,0.5),rgba(39, 151, 216,0.5)), url('images/home.jpg');<br>
                    }
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>After applying the class mentioned above on an image of the website, we will get the result similar to this.</p>
            <img class="main-image" src="images/group-overlay.png" alt="Image after applying background overlay effect.">
            <h2>Setting background color for text</h2>
            <p>As the heading says, by setting the background color for the text we can overcome the contrast problem between an image and the text in front of it. I really don't recommend this method, as the background of the text blocks some parts of the image and looks awkward.</p>
            <p>After applying the background color to the text, we will get the something similar to this.</p>
            <img class="main-image" src="images/group-back.png" alt="Image after applying background color for the text.">
